# Comparing the persuasiveness of role-playing large language models and human experts on polarized U.S. political issues
This repository contains the data and code to support the paper [Comparing the persuasiveness of role-playing large language models and human experts on polarized U.S. political issues](https://osf.io/preprints/osf/ey8db), authored by Kobi Hackenburg, Lujain Ibrahim, Ben Tappin, and Manos Tsakiris

## Repository Content
### Data
* [final_dataset.csv](https://github.com/lujainibrahim/llm-roleplaying/blob/main/data/final_dataset.csv) in the `data` folder is the final processed dataset that is used in the analyses.
* The `raw_data` folder in the `data` folder contains the raw experiment data.
* The `messages` folder contains the messages generated by GPT-4 and political communication experts.

#### For the Analysis in our project
We use data from the paper on LLM roleplaying (cited at the end of this file). The process for extracting and creating the data sets for our interpretation is as follows:

| **Variable Name** | **Description**                                                               | **Number of Observations** |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `data_ai_clean`   | LLM-generated messages only (Dem, Repub, Neutral). Human and control removed. | 3,298                      |
| `roleplay`        | Subset of `data_ai_clean` with only role-playing LLMs (Dem or Repub).         | 2,196                      |
| `align`           | Subset of `roleplay` where LLM role matches participant's party affiliation.  | 1,104                      |
| `align_dem`       | Subset of `align` where LLM role-played as Democrat.                          | 548                        |
| `align_repub`     | Subset of `align` where LLM role-played as Republican.                        | 556                        |

Binary variables in our data

| **Variable** | **Coding**                            |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `sex`        | `Female` = 1, `Male` = 0, `Other` = 3 |
| `dem`        | Democrat = 0                          |
| `repub`      | Republican = 1                        |
| `aligned`    | Match = 1, Mismatch = 0               |
